## Background
Discovering differentially expressed genes in various tissues has many important applications including the prediction of drug translation from animal to human models, and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has been an instrumental tool in this process. Currently, there is very little understanding of the gene expression patterns between human retinal cells and mouse retinal cells. Here, I utilized scRNA-seq of mouse, human, and primate retinal cells as the basis of my analysis. I perform statistical integration and clustering to find genes that are conserved, and perform a differential expression analysis between the human and mouse retinal cells. I was able to conclude that phototransduction genes were the most differentially expressed.

This research was completed during the B.I.G. Summer 2020 program at UCLA.
